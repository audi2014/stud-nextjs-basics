## Artur Perepelytsa

I am a Full-stack developer.
I've come a long way from a mobile/game developer to a full-stack engineer in node.js ecosystem.
Compared to other ecosystems, community of web developers is constantly growing, experimenting,
creating new frameworks and development approaches. And that's what fascinates me.
